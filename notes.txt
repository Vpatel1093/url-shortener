Notes:
- The makefile has instructions on installing the application and running the local server on port 8080, essentially
  Rails and its dependencies must be installed and the rails server must be specified to run on the designated port
- To use the app, a user navigates to the root path (http://localhost:8080/) where they can enter the url they would
  like shortened. They receive an error message should the url not be valid, otherwise they see a success message
  with their shortened url which they can copy. Entering the shortened url in the browser will navigate the user to
  the url they entered.

Design Considerations:
- The url the user inputs is sanitized when saving the record in order to properly redirect the user when they enter
  the shortened url
- RSpec was the test suite of choice, and the full suite can be ran via terminal with `rspec spec/`
- Unobtrusive javascript was used rather than adding jquery for the backend call to create the slug as it comes packaged
  with Rails. This was to minimize dependencies and improve load time of the page
